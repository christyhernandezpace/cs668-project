    "As said in my Project Overview Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "New Jersey is my home state – as well as home to a diverse population and a wide range of school districts, from affluent suburban areas to urban centers and rural communities. However, this diversity presents a challenge: significant disparities in educational resources, funding, and student outcomes persist across different districts. This imbalance in resources has direct implications on student performance, educational opportunities, and overall equity within the state's educational system. Addressing these disparities, especially the most impactful ones, can lead to more targeted policy interventions and an overall improvement in educational outcomes across New Jersey. \n",
    "\n",
    "In response to this opportunity, the goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of educational equity across school districts in New Jersey, identifying relationships between resources and student outcomes. By examining factors such as funding, teacher-student ratios, and access to technology, the analysis will identify which variables have the most impact on student success. The project will evaluate and propose evidence-based interventions, like increased school funding or mentorship programs, aimed at closing the achievement gap. The final deliverable will be a machine learning model that predicts the potential impact of these interventions on educational outcomes, particularly in underserved communities. This model will allow us to highlight specific areas where inequities are most pronounced and propose targeted, data-driven solutions to address them. By leveraging pre-existing and publicly available datasets from the State of New Jersey, I aim to generate actionable insights that can guide state and local policymakers in promoting a more equitable distribution of resources and improving educational outcomes."

I did admittedly struggle to find the appropriate dataset and the most useful features to compare, but now that I have this foundation I think I should be able to pick up speed. For the next code draft submission, according to my objective timeline, I need to conduct exploratory data analysis, incorporate feature engineering, and develop my machine learning prediction model! In addition, I will be sure to clean up any previous parts along the way. \n",
